# Clinez
#### Simple Clines Generator &amp;&amp; Checker written in python.

Also called Cline, CCcline, CCcam and Camd. Card sharing is a method that allows multiple clients to access a digital TV subscription. A C-line or CCCAM is a string that describes where to gain that access. It is basically composed of a server address, a port, a user name and a password. Various specialized sites provide C-lines.

## USAGE
* Open Clinez directory and start terminal.
* Install Requirements.txt using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 
* Run ```./start.sh``` inside terminal and follow instructions.
* Done! grab a coffee and wait!

## Caution 
* Only two CCcam providers added at the moment.
* If the checker returns errors or stuck on the same cline for a long time, it might due to the website clines checking issues, try again in a few hours, and it should work :)

## Hint 
Make sure you generated more than 1000+ clines to test them, you should eventually get a good clines.
